ADDENDUM #2: FISH Results 
ADDENDUM #2 
ADDITIONAL TESTING: Fluorescence In-S itu Hybridization (FISH) for HER2  ( ERBB2) gene amplification:  
A: Left breast 12 o’clock, 
1 cm from nipple, needle core biopsy 
Invasive ductal carcinoma: 
POSITIVE for HER2 gene amplification by FISH ratio criteria M onosomy of 
CEP-17 present (see  comment below) 
COMMENT: The invasive carcinoma is POSITIVE for HER2 amplification, with an overall 
HER2/CEP17 ratio of 2.1. Approximately 30% of the analyzed cells have monosomy for the CEP17 signal, which is 
contributing to the e levated
 ratio. However, there are increased copies of the HER2 gene with an average of 4.0 HER2 
copies/cell (range: 1-1 0 copies p
er cell) with 15% of the cells greater than or equal to 6.

Comment: A manual count was performed by  two separate technologists. 
According to the CAP/ASCO 2013 Recommendations, amplification is defined as a HER2/CEP17 signal ratio ≥ 2.0 and/or single-prove 
average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals/cell (JCO 31:3997-4013, 2013). Signal ratios < 2.0 and/or single-probe average HER2 copy number < 
4.0 is considered negative. Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with an average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 signals/cell is considered to be 
an “equivocal” result, and should be tested with an alternative assay and/or a new specimen, if available. The results  of this test are meant to be 
used as an adjunct to other prognostic indicators. Pathology Report 
Patient: Mott, Elizabeth S18-34 9833 Methodology : Fluoresc ence in situ hybridization (FISH)  for HER-2/neu gene amplification (using PathVysion probes and manual 
scoring).  
This test was modified  from the FDA-a pproved protocol and its performance characte ristics determined by  Spring Street Laboratories, New York, NY 10013. This test is for  
clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is regulated under the 1988 CLIA amendments as qualified to per form high 
complexity clinical testing.
