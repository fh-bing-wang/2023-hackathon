CLINICAL INFORMATION 
A - left breast ultrasound-gu ided needle core biopsy at 12 o'clock 1 cm from nipple. The specimen was put into formation at 09:26 
a.m. on 04/12/2018
, this will have a total tim e in formalin of 11 hours and 26 minutes. B - left axilla ultrasound-gu ided biopsy. The
specimen was put into formali
n at 09:42 a.m. on 04/12/2018, this will have a total time in formalin of 11 hours and 10 minutes.
ICD Code(s): N

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
A: Received in formalin, labeled "Elizabeth Mott", "Lt 12 o'clock N+1", are four  0.2 cm in diameter and ranging in length from 
1.2-1 .7 cm por
tions of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted in A1.  
B: Received in formalin, labeled "Elizabeth Mott", "Lt axilla", are three 0.1 cm  in diameter and ranging in length from 0.7-1. 4 cm 
portions of
 fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted in B1. Received on 04/12/2018 are two alcohol-fi xed, direct 
smears and two air-d ried direct smears labeled "E Mott" "B: Left axilla". The alcohol-f ixed s mears are Papanicolaou s tained, and 
the air-d ried smears are Wright s
tained. (rc) 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY 
Methodology: Formalin-f ixed, pa
raffin embedded tissue and appropriate positive and negative controls are visualized using a polymer-b ased detection system. Unless 
otherwise noted,
 all controls were reviewed and met expectations. Results are outlined below:

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY 
Methodology: Immunohistochem istry studies for estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR) receptors (using rabbit monoc lonal antibody clone SP1 for ER from Ventana and 
mouse monoclonal antibody clone 16 for PR from Leica) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue s ections . Positive and negative controls s how 
appropriate reactivity. Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on manual estimation o f the percentage of positive nuclei in tum or cells. Results are as follows:  
Source: Block A1 
Population: Cells of i nterest 
Antibody Result  Comment  
ERsq 98% of tumor cells positive Variable weak to moderate to strong 
nuclear staining 
PRsq 2% of tumor cells positive Weak to moderate nuclear staining 
Interpreted By: Yoonjung Yang MD 
Comment:  
Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as  1% positive tumor cells for ER/PR m ay correlate with a significantly improved 
clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant hormonal therapy. Based on this information, tumors  showing 1% or greater of tumor cell 
nuclear staining for E R/PR may be considered positive.

Antibodies to 
[Clone] Result 
HER2[4B5] EQUIVOCAL (2+) 
Comment: This tumor shows a 2+ level of immunostaining (IHC) which, according to the 2013 revised ASCO-C AP Guidelines (Wolff 
AC et al., J Clin Oncol 31:3997-40 13, 2013), puts it in the category of “equivocal” HER2 status by IHC.  
Please refer to the Spring Street Laboratories  report (SS2018-34 383-01) for a complete description o f the results and further details. A copy will be re tained in the patient’s 
record. If you would like to receiv e a copy of this report, please contact us at 866-348-349 3.
