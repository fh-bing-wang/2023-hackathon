EXAM DESCRIPTION: 
PET/CT of the body APRIL 19, 2018 
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 
Reason: Breast carcinoma, staging  
TECHNIQUE: 
The patient was administered 12.9 3 mCi of  fluorin e 18 FDG IV via the right antec ubital 
fossa and imaging from mid skul l to mid thigh performed with c oncurren tly acquired CT 
through this same area for attenu ation co rrection  and anatomical localization. F asting 
blood glucose was 102 mg/dL. Sc an start time was at 1045 hours .

No comparison 
FINDINGS: 
The large left axillary nodal mass which has recently been biopsied is seen. This 
measures about 4 cm in greatest diameter with maximum SUV at 15.2. There is an area in 
the left breast which is hypermetabolic with maximum SUV at 7.1. Unfortunately in 
addition there is evidence of widespread metastatic disease. There are multiple areas of 
hilar and mediastinal adenopathy with maximum SUV of 7.6 in a subcarinal nodal mass. 
There are multiple hepatic metastases suspicious for metastasis as well as multiple 
skeletal lesions. Largest area of involvement appears to be the T12 vertebral body with 
the majority of the T12 vertebral body showing a predominantly osteolytic process with 
maximum SUV at 8.1. Few small pulmonary nodules are seen below the resolution of PET but 
these are non-specific. Right renal cyst is noted with caval filter in place. Uterus has 
been removed.
IMPRESSION:
Left breast mas s with associat ed axillary adenopathy and widespread metastatic disease as 
described.
